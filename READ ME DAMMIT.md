This is an edit of CodeHud by puoi1 that was an edit of ahud by n0kk. Im pretty sure you know what this hud contains if you used ahud or even puoi1's edit. Note: this was meant for private use originally so I don't plan on updating it, but since someone was actually interested I decided to post it
anyway. Also the default configuration for the medi gun charge is the center charge found in ahud and the other one that is named "DEFAULT_CENTER" or something is the same as the default medigun charge but in the center, though I thought that it was too big compared to the current one made by n0kk. If you want
to use the default ahud configuration for the medigun charge, simply copy the ahud default charge file into the someHud file.Or if you want the default center charge I 'made' just rename it to the same name as the default charge in the ui folder and replace it. Also if you don't like the opaque white part of the scoreboard simply change the transparency from 255 to something else like 100 in the scoreboard.res file. If you don't know how to edit colors 
in huds look it up, you'll end up finding that its quite easy.
IMPORTANT (kinda): finding the master is a little weird since this is my first time using github and its pretty tricky when you're making your first upload! But if you keep clicking on the zips and folders you'll find it!
